  # The +Database+ object is passed to the block if it's given, and

  # Examples:

  # Connecting to stores with our current credentials:

    # Preparing a statement:

    # +options+ can be a Hash object with the following possible keys:
    #
    #   :scroll => true or false

    # Examples:
    #
    # This creates a +SequentialCursor+

    #   :scroll => true or false
    #   :hold   => true or false

    # Examples:
