	* fixes an compile-time error in Ruby 2.x: "error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment"

0.8.0  2012-04-17
------------------
Bugs fixed:
	* test cases were not loading the just built extension

New features:
	* Ruby 1.9.3 compatibility
	* Rake task for running tests

Minor changes:
	* Warns to set the Informix environment variables when installing the gem
	* gemspec file added

------------------
Bugs fixed:
	* CursorBase#drop was raising an ArgumentError exception on Ruby 1.8.7

Caveats:
	* Database#each and Database#each_hash removed. Use Database#foreach and
	  Database#foreach_hash instead.

------------------
Bugs fixed:
	* rb_cArray symbol was duplicated

Caveats:
	* Database#each and Database#each_hash renamed to Database#foreach and
	  Database#foreach_hash respectively.


0.7.1  04/02/2008
------------------
Bugs fixed:
	* The name of Informix resources were not unique. This problem was
	  introduced in 0.7.0. It doesn't affect previous versions.
	* The documentation insisted that Database#execute is an alias for
	  Database#immediate.
	* Cursor for Database#columns was prepared and declared every time it was
	  called.


0.7.0  03/31/2008
------------------
New features:
	* Experimental support for the INTERVAL data type:
		- year_to_month, day_to_fraction, from_months and from_seconds class
		  methods for creating an Interval object
		- +@ and -@ unary operators
		- +, * and / operations available with Integer, Rational, Date, Time
		  and DateTime objects
		- methods for returning the respective fields of an Interval object
		  individually (years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds)
		- to_a method for returning the fields of an Interval object as an array
		- methods for converting the Interval object to the given unit, where
		  apply (to_years, to_months, to_days, to_hours, to_minutes and
		  to_seconds)
		- to_s method for displaying an Interval object as an string according
		  to ANSI SQL standards
		- includes Comparable
	* Database#version returns a struct with version information of the database
	  server.
	* Database#each and Database#each_hash shortcut methods for declaring and
	  opening a cursor in a single step.
	  Contributed by Reid Morrison <reidmo at gmail>
	* Database#execute is not an alias for Database#immediate any more.
	  It has become a shortcut for preparing and executing a statement in a
	  single step.
	* SequentialCursor includes Enumerable
	* Ruby 1.9 compatible
	* More and better documentation

Bugs fixed:
	* The documentation for class Error was not being recognized by rdoc

Remarks:
	* Database.new deprecated in favor of Database.open
	* Database#do was removed
	* A lot of C code has been reimplemented in Ruby
	* Modules and classes have been reorganized
	* Database#execute still behaves the same, except that it can also accept
	  input parameters and return at most one record. Database#immediate is
	  more efficient though.


0.6.2  10/20/2007
------------------
Bugs fixed:
	* Microsoft's cl compiler was failing due to a variable declaration
	  where it is not allowed.

	  Noticed by Joe Lanotte <joe.lanotte at comcast dot net>


0.6.1  10/13/2007
------------------
Bugs fixed:
	* Database#columns was returning an empty array from within the
	  Informix ActiveRecord adapter
	  (ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::InformixAdapter#columns) if
	  called for different tables. This bug was raising the following
	  error in Ruby on Rails:

		undefined method columname=

	  Noticed by Andrés Rafael <aandresrafael at gmail dot com>


0.6.0  08/28/2007
------------------
New features:
	* Test suite
	* Error, Warning, and AssertionFailure classes replace RuntimeError when
	  raising exceptions.

	  Error class methods: 
		- message
		- sql_code
		- add_info
		- []
		- each
		- to_s
		- size, length

	  message and sql_code reference the first error message. Following
	  errors can be accessed through Error#[] as ExcInfo objects.

	  ExcInfo is a Struct with the following members:
		- sql_code
		- sql_state
		- class_origin_val
		- subclass_origin_val
		- message
		- server_name
		- connection_name

	  See test/testcase.rb for a simple example of exception handling.

	* Informix.version returns the version of this extension
	* Database#do aliased as Database#execute
	* More documentation

Remarks:
	* Database#do is deprecated and will be removed in next versions. Use
	  Database#execute or Database#immediate instead.

	* In case of Informix errors, RuntimeError objects are no longer raised.
	  Error, Warning and AssertionFailure objects are raised instead.

0.5.1  08/10/2007
------------------
Bugs fixed:
	* When a DATETIME HOUR TO SECOND column had a value with leading zeroes
	  it was incorrectly interpreted.
	  Reported by Daniel Bush <dlb.id.au at gmail>


0.5.0  12/27/2006
------------------
New features:
	* Easier to install
	* BigDecimal accepted for input parameters
	* BigDecimal used for instantiating DECIMAL and MONEY values
	* Cursor, Statement, Slob and Database accept an optional block that
	  automatically frees resources after execution.
	  Based on ideas and pseudo-code by
	  Edwin Fine <emofine at finecomputerconsultants dot com> and me.
	* Database#slob shortcut for creating Slob objects.
	* Slob::Stat class implemented. Returned by Slob#stat, represents the
	  SLOB status. Methods: atime, ctime, mtime, refcnt and size. Includes
	  Comparable.
	* Slob new methods: <<, rewind, stat, pos, pos=, lock, unlock,
	                    estbytes, extsz, flags, maxbytes, sbspace,
	                    extsz=, flags=,
	                    atime, ctime, mtime, refcnt and size
	* Thread safe

Remarks:
	* DECIMAL and MONEY columns are no longer returned as Float. BigDecimal
	  is used instead.

Bugs fixed:
	* If there was an error reading (ifx_lo_read) an SLOB, memory
	  allocated for the read buffer was not freed. Noticed by
	  Edwin Fine <emofine at finecomputerconsultants dot com>
	* maxbytes option was ignored when creating an Slob object
	* Documentation for Slob mentioned an RDRW constant, but it actually
	  is RDWR.

Special thanks to Guy Bowerman, Jonathan Leffler and Logan Capaldo for their
feedback and help.


0.4.0  12/13/2006

		- slice!, prev!, next!, first!, last!, current!
		- slice_hash, prev_hash, next_hash, first_hash, last_hash,
		  current_hash!
		- slice_hash!, prev_hash!, next_hash!, first_hash!, last_hash!,
		  current_hash!
	* New Cursor#id method that returns the cursor name for use in
	  update cursors

Bugs fixed:
	* Memory for input parameters was allocated before statement/cursor
	  preparation but not freed if preparation failed.


0.3.0  11/26/2006

New features:
	* Initial support for Smart Large Objects (BLOB/CLOB).
	  Operations supported:

		- fetch_hash_many(n), fetch_hash_all

		- fetch!, fetch_hash!, each!, each_hash!

	  where !-methods reduce object creation by reusing the same result
	  object in each call

	  no records are found

Bugs fixed:
	* When freeing a cursor that was opened but never used, a segmentation
	  fault occurred
